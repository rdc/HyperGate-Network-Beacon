HyperGate Network Beacon
========================

This script will add any Region to the HyperGate Network at http://TheHyperGates.com

Complete HyperGate Client Scripts available at: https://github.com/rdc/HyperGate


Until now, the only way to add a Region to the HyperGate Network was to rez and run a full HyperGate. Even though the HyperGate can be installed quite easily, it utilizes several scripts and can require more simulator resources than a "lite" simulator can provide.

Now, with this lite "Network Beacon" script, any Region can now be added to the HyperGate Network without running a full HyperGate.


Notes
=====

Full HyperGates will always have priority in the Busy and Popular HyperGate menus and on the web site.

Anyone who is already running a full HyperGate already has the Network Beacon capabilities built in to their HyperGate and does not need to run a separate Network Beacon script.

One Network Beacon will add an entire Region to the HyperGate Network. There is no need to have more than one Network Beacon on a Region.



Prerequisites
============

- The Region must be HyperGrid enabled and accessible via the HyperGrid
- The Owner of this Network Beacon must be registered on the HyperGate Network (See Owner Registration)
- The Network Beacon must be rezzed on the same home grid as the Owner of the Beacon. Rezzing a beacon on a foreign grid will not add that Region or Grid to the HyperGate Network.


Installation
============

To create your own Network Beacon, perform these instructions in-world.

1. Create a new Script

2. Copy the contents of the "HyperGate Network Beacon Script" into your new Script

3. Drop your new Script into any object on the Region that you would like to add to the HyperGate Network


Owner Registration
==================

Anyone can add any Region to the HyperGate Network as long as they have Build permissions some where on the Region, even if they are not the Owner of the Region.

The Owner of the Network Beacon must be registered on the HyperGate Network. The process for Owner Registration is as follows:

* Use the avatar that owns the Network Beacon to jump to a registered HyperGate that is on a grid other than the home grid of the Beacon Owner. Then use that HyperGate to jump to any other location. It is important to use a HyperGate that is already registered on the HyperGate Network.

If you have already used a registered HyperGate on a grid other than your home grid, then your avatar has already been registered on the HyperGate Network.
